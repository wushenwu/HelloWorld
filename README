Greeting from wenboxu,

Here is the trying for Git.

During this, we've met a few questions, and we just log here.

1)
https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo   

this is the instruction we just followed

2)  Problem when 'git push' in git bash

fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': No such file or directory

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20871549/error-when-push-commits-with-github-fatal-could-not-read-username

finally we replace https://github.com/USER/REPO.git 
with git@github.com:USER/REPO.git according to the url above.

3) Problem when login with github GUI

We just met the same question, and we solved just by installing .NET Framework.

So, now feel free and enjoy yourself.
